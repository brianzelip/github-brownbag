slides should have one phrase at most, with a graphic some times too.

Start close with the idea that:
  
  "GitHub is a networked/online service that leverages git to provide the service of networked source and version control."
    -- source control is akin to creating slides as pdfs that start as a powerpoint -- the .pptx file is the source file (or the development version), the pdf is the output (or the production version)

    -- version control is keeping track of the history of file(s) changes over time, the who and the what happened to files as they changed.


it's a gui and a network for leveraging git
  what started out as a command line tool is now available with buttons and drop down menus, with the benefit of being on the internet.

  AS FAR AS GITHUB AS LEARNING TO CODE, OR THE LEARNING TO LEARN ECOSYSTEM

  [PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED image]

  When Windows 95 and 98 was the operating system of the day, we taught our grandparents and other computer newbies to start using the computer by playing solitaire and changing the background color on the desktop - very rudimentary tasks that teach basic navigation of the operating system.

  When one starts to learn to program, the command line is introduced. And the method of learning to use the command line is similar to learning windows 95, you learn basic navigation.
