Good afternoon, welcome, and thanks very much for attending today's Technology Brown Bag that will explore GitHub as it relates to academic research.

My name is Brian Zelip, and I've just recently joined the UMB faculty as the Emerging Technologies Librarian here at HSHSL.

Before we go further I'd like to mention that our next Brown Bag will look at 3D printing in the Health Sciences.

We will have a special guest with us for that event, Dr. Gene Shirokobrod who is a member of the UMB faculty in the School of Medicine and co-founded a local company based around a 3d printed physical therapy device called The Arc.

The library began providing 3D printing resources earlier this year that are proving of interest to various folks around campus.

So mark your calendar for October 29 and join us for that interesting conversation.

Today we'll be talking about the what and why of GitHub but not the how.

So it's important to note that you can learn how to use GitHub through a workshop that the library is offering throughout the Fall semester.

In addition to workshops, our library provides a wide range of research support services, some of which are noted here.

These services include IRB form review, Systematic review support, an analysis of the impact your research is making, a presentation practice studio and more.

Find out about all of these resources and more at our website.

GitHub is a cloud service that provides tools and functionalities that are particularly well suited for modern science.

GitHub's applicability isn't only suited for science though, it's very useful for anyone who works with electronic files of any type.

At the heart of GitHub is git

[SLIDE]

Git is a robust open source version control system.

GitHub has made a successful business by making git easy to use and accessible over the internet.

This is similar to how Box and Dropbox have made a business out of something common to everyone - storage, which everyone has to some extent, but they make it easy to use, cheap, and available over the internet.

So git is a version control system. A version control system is a tool that manages and restores versions and revisions of projects.

It is similar to revision control on a Microsoft Word document, only much more robust.

For example, two teams of researchers working on code to analyze and clean up some research data can use git to collaboratively work on and debug the code in such a way that none of the researchers needs to worry about overwriting or deleting anyone elseâ€™s work.

They can also see the reasoning behind all changes and track multiple branches of revisions with a built-in backup strategy.

In this way, version-control systems are extraordinarily important to researchers in collaborative environments, as well as anyone looking to track how a project has evolved over time.

As a project evolves, it is useful to be able to see how a document has changed and have the ability to revert to older versions if necessary.

Version control systems have been around since at least the 70s, but git is now the most dominant form.

Git was built in the early 2000s to help manage the development of the linux operating system which had thousands of collaborators all over the world.

The version control system they had been using up to that point was bought and privatized a company which made it impossible to use freely.

So they set out to build their own versioning system, and in doing so, improved upon all those that had come before.

The advantage that comes from git that tops the previous tools is that it is a distributed version control system.

This means that everyone who is working on a project has their own copy of the project, as opposed to previous tools that centralized the project's source.

So this brings up two of the most important functionalities that github leverages - the ease of copying an entire project's files, and the ability to walk through all previous versions of a project's lifecycle.

In git and GitHub speak, a project's workspace is referred to as a repository, and the act of copying a repository is called forking, or making a fork.

GitHub facilitates open source (or open science)

You can see GitHub's cost structure in the handout -- this is what separated github from similar services like bitbucket - the key is in the collaboration, not the privacy.

The tools that make this possible are the enhancements that GitHub provides on top of git.

These tools include collaboration tools like wikis and discussion threads that accompany every repository on GitHub.

LEARNING ON DEMAND

all of the learning to code - these resources usually have a large focus on learning computer skills.

it's also an entry point to learn about computing at a deeper level than navigating the web and microsoft through buttons and drop down menus

the way we used to teach the computer thru navigating simple configurations, the terminal is like that , and git plays very well with that.


there's also a huge network effect to github because so many people are using it.

you can use it as a search engine for useful or interestig projects

people use it as a teaching tool all the time






GitHub workflow

Use GitHub with local computers through its app or the command line






Questions
Does anyone have any experience with git or GitHub?

How are folks managing their documents as they change over time?
